# Search-SWE base images

This directory contains the reproducible build contexts for the shared
Search-SWE CPU and GPU base images. The published images and their tags are
available in the [Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/hanhainebula/search-swe-base).

| Build context | Published tag | Use case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`cpu/`](cpu/) | `hanhainebula/search-swe-base:cpu-py3.12-1.0.0` | CPU tasks |
| [`gpu/`](gpu/) | `hanhainebula/search-swe-base:gpu-cu13.0-py3.12-1.0.0` | GPU tasks on an NVIDIA-capable host |

Each context contains its `Dockerfile`, pinned `requirements.txt`, and an
`environment.md` package/runtime summary. Both images target `linux/amd64`.

Build from the repository root:

```bash
docker build --platform linux/amd64 \
  -t search-swe-base:cpu-py3.12-1.0.0 \
  docker/cpu

docker build --platform linux/amd64 \
  -t search-swe-base:gpu-cu13.0-py3.12-1.0.0 \
  docker/gpu
```

The GPU image includes CUDA 13.0 userspace. Running its GPU checks requires a
compatible NVIDIA driver and NVIDIA Container Toolkit on the host.
