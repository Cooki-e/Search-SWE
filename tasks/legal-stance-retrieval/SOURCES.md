The full corpus is the earlier deterministic shuffled JSONL conversion: all
3,126 source records, stable opaque IDs, all original source fields and rendered
case/term/facts/question/conclusion text. Its SHA-256 is
`5e83cadbf0d47762a1a3aadb0883aaed6ce5d155206c22b4b6c1d89523cb8fc5`.
The model card declares Apache-2.0 for Qwen3-Embedding-0.6B. Exact model file pins
and hashes are in `assets.json`.

The annotation lineage is retained outside agent mounts at
`task_development/legal-precedent-retrieval/screening/official-test-cleaning`:

- `cleaned/manifest.jsonl` accounts for every original binary test row.
- `agent-source-decisions.json` and `agent-pair-decisions.json` distinguish final
  review decisions from raw local model proposals.
- `cleaned/test/evidence.jsonl` retains accepted stance, original case text and
  reasons; `cleaned/test-cases.md` is the readable review record.
- `training-overlap-decisions.jsonl` and `test-dedup-decisions.json` record the
  reviewed proposition exclusions without removing every shared case.
- `cleaned/validation.json` and `checksums.json` preserve export verification.

Packaging copies the accepted test query/qrels bytes unchanged. Training query
rows retain only `query_id`, `query`, `stance`; original positive document-ID
seeds become binary `relevance` maps. The original training labels are not
claimed as fully corrected. An `all` training example therefore has the same
known positive seeds as its source direction, not a guarantee of exhaustive
support/refutation coverage. Training and all-mode variants remain associated
through their input IDs for agent-chosen splitting.

The 311 frozen test propositions are quality-selected, not selected for poor
model scores. Binary relevance reflects recorded majority holdings even when a
historical rule later changed. These judgments do not certify current legal
validity. All accepted positives have explicit review decisions, but unreviewed
pairs can still contain missed positives; the metric uses the frozen pooled
qrels and treats other IDs as zero gain. No data or model assets have been
published by this packaging step.

Public packaging now uses `data/examples`. The source query ID prefix `train_` is replaced bijectively by `example_` in both examples files. Original source IDs remain in the author audit; no query text, stance, case ID or relevance map changes. The frozen hidden query IDs and qrels are untouched.
